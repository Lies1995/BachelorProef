Possible questions
slide 6: How can you see that the second term is negativ?

slide 7: What are these approximantions and why are they valid? 
	1. Fluence rate is proportiononal to spatial distribution of the
	temperature increase for all times. 
		logical: high power -> higher T
	2. radial distribution of fluence rate represented by a zero-order 
	Bessel function, the axial distribution by a cosine function.	
		This is a typical solution when solving T(t,z,r)= theta(t)phi(z,r) 
		with the right boundary conditions with the method of seperations of
		variables.
	3. T=phi=0 for z>z0 and r>r0
		This is only valid when the thermal diffusion length is smaler then r0 
		z0. For z0 this is not a problem, for r0 this gives a limitation of the
		model. sqrt(4 k t_{puls}/ rho c)
	4. optical and thermal properties are independent of temperature. 
		They do depend on temperature, but here the temperature changes are to
		smal.
slide 7: Why has this graf a different chape than your solutions?
	It has a logaritmic scale.
slide 10: Why is there a difference in temperature for different wavelengths?
	For 560nm the temperature is larger because the absorption is higher 
	because of absorption from hemoglobin. 
slide 10: Why is there a difference in temperature for different fibers?
	Because tau is bigger for a MM there is more time for the energy to be
	absorbed by the tissue, so the temperature can become larger.
slide 14: Why didn't you do an error analysis for the pulsed stimulation?

Why don't you just use numerical solutions?
	They are indeed more precise, but they need much computation time and
	they give less insight in the relation between the tissue and thermal 
	properties and the temperature rise.
